However, ever since getting on the train most of the guests have been cold and distant to you, until one night you hear a loud scream and a distant thud. You wake up in a cold sweat, wondering what it could have been.\n";
	string detRoomDescription = "\nIn your room, the bed looks as though someone had just woken up. To the right of the bed is an exquisitely carved wooden dresser with some personal items on top. Through the window across the room, you see the landscape racing by and the sun rising over the horizon. Behind you is the door.\n";
	string NHallDescription = "\nThe bleak hallway is dimly lit but, you can see two distinct lights. One from the bathrooms across the hall from the room on the left, and one from the room on the right.\n";
	string northBathDescription = "\nIn the middle of the room lies a body on the ground with their blood soaking the tile around them. You see another person, a doctor, crouching over them as if studying them.\n";
	string northBathCorpse = "\nThe person is definitely dead. They have a tiny puncture wound on their arm, and there is some blood spilling from the side of their head. In the puddle of blood you also see an empty syringe with remnants of some unknown substance in it.\n";
	string docDescription = "\nYou gather from their stance that they are studying the body, and that this person could be a doctor.\n";
	string docConversation = "\nYou: What happened here?\nDoctor: It's not what it looks like! I ran here after I heard a noise.\nYou: Ok, but can you tell me what you know?\nDoctor: All I know is when I heard the noise I heard running outside my door and I immediately went to check whatever the noise was.\nYou: Ok, thank you.\n";
	string docRoomDescription = "\nYou enter a very clean and neat room. On the right is a bed that was made recently, and a dresser with a couple belongings on top. Straight ahead is a cracked open window.\n";
	string docWindowDescription = "\nThe window has been pushed slightly ajar, as if someone just wanted to hear the sounds of the wind. There is a smudge of a hand on the glass towards the bottom of the window.\n";

	string boothDescription = "\nAll of the booths are clean as if no one has used them yet today, except one. A big wrench is sitting on the table the engineer is sitting at.\n";
	string engDescription = "\nYou see a man with big burly hands stained with grease. He has a stern look on his face, lost in thought. You notice a big wrench on the table in front of him.\n";
	string engConversation = "\nYou: Hello, do you know what happened?\nEngineer: What do you mean?\nYou: There was an incident, did you see anything?\nEngineer: Not anything out of the ordinary. What sort of incident?\nYou: Nevermind, thanks.\n";

	string butDescription = "\nA meek man who looks as though they are in a perpetual state of nervousness. He has some nice slacks with a small sloth hanging over his arm. You deduce that this man is probably the butler to a well-off person.\n";
